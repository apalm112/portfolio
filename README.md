# portfolio
This is my Code 301 portfolio project, which will highlight my Github projects and coding interests.  It will be a static portfolio site created from scratch & will gain new features throughout the course.

App live on Heroku: https://portfolio-301d3.herokuapp.com/

TODO's:
    -- Debug the CSS for the header <h1>
    -- Debug repo data is not being removed from the DOM, multiple projects tab clicks will append just as many repos to the DOM.
    -- Debug About Section not being hidden on home page
    -- Debug About Section not displaying properly when About tab is clicked
