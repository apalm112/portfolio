# portfolio
This is my Code 301 portfolio project, which will highlight my Github projects and coding interests.  It will be a static portfolio site created from scratch & will gain new features throughout the course.

App live on Heroku: https://portfolio-301d3.herokuapp.com/

TODO's:
    -- Fix the CSS for the header <h1>
    -- get the .get() call & Handlebars template to append the repo info to the DOM.
